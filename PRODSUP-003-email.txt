CircleCI is the Continuous Integration tools generally used at software development shops across the IT industry, to build packages, integration of test suites and deployment. Itâ€™s a complete CI&CD tool which can perform end to end automation of software packages from code commit to deployment to production following the SDLC 

CicrleCi is pretty simple to apply and just work as plug and play with most of the standard projects. In case, if your project need some special setup then there are many possible ways and integrations to suit different type of needs.

One can configure it to watch Git repo and build on latest commits which includes test and on success it will get deployed on to designated server or environment.
