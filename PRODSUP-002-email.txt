Case 2 : PRODSUP-002

Hi Jolene,

Thanks for contacting CircleCi support team today.

As I understand that you are facing an issue with the project in CirceCi and is not getting a build complete status.

In order to understand the issue, I need to replicate the same at my end. hence did a fork of code as its publically available.

I did a build and got stuck there for 15-20 min but build wasn't successful It was executing slowly with following message on the dashboard

		-----------------------------------------------------
		 T E S T S
		-----------------------------------------------------
		Running org.apache.commons.csv.CSVFormatTest
		.................................................

Hence, I did check the CSVFormat.java file and found out that following file around line 795 has a for loop printing dots for (20*60*60)/ 72000 times and has sleep call as well, this is where the whole process execution seems to be stuck. 

		commons-csv/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/csv/CSVFormat.java  : 795
		----------------------------------------------------------------
		/**
		* Verifies the consistency of the parameters and throws an IllegalArgumentException if necessary.
		*
		* @throws IllegalArgumentException
		*/
		private void validate() throws IllegalArgumentException {
		for (int i=0; i<20*60*60; i++) {
		    System.out.print('.');
		    try {
		        Thread.currentThread().sleep(1000);
		    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
		        break;
		    }
		}

As I donâ€™t understand the reason of above snippet ,  but built was successful after removal of this block from the code. 

I believe the reason for build failure is above code which runs for 72000 times and goes way above from default timeout value of 600s, default value is also mentioned here: https://circleci.com/docs/configuration/

Please revert if you have any other issue reading the project or suggestion for the above solution.

Regards
Yaswani
