Case 1 : PRODSUP-001

Hi Harry, 

Thanks for contacting CircleCi support today. 

As I understand: You added a java project from github ( https://github.com/mtedone/podam) to Circleci and after successful or  green build  the Test Results tab is empty. 

In order to replicate the issue at my end, I did a fork of code built it using CircleCI . I found out that code is missing a circle.yml in its root directory, also it’s a maven build which needs a maven surefire plugin to generate test report

Here is a link : https://circleci.com/docs/test-metadata/#java-junit-results-with-maven-surefire-plugin

Please create a circle.yml file in the root directory of the project with following content and re-run:

test:
  override:
    - mvn clean install
  post:
    - mkdir -p $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/
    - find . -type f -regex ".*/target/failsafe-reports/.*xml" -exec cp {} $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/ \;


Please feel free to revert if issue persist or for any other queries regarding this.

Thanks Again
Regards
Yaswani
